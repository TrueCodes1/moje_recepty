##  🔍 What Moje Recepty is? 

Moje Recepty is kind of social network for anybody to share their favorite recipes with others. This React + Node.js (EXPRESS) app allows users to upload name, ingredients, tutorial, photos and videos for each of their recipes. Friends can like each other recipe, comment on it or easily add to the library of their favorite. Do not doubt about joining us! 

The front end of this web app is built in React using styled components and hooks. Except for this, we are using JS/CSS keyframes to support any kind of animation.

The back end runs on Node.js (EXPRESS) server using the MongoDB as the main database (we are in porccess of choosing the best storage provider, as we need to store the photos/videos for each of the recipe). Except for this, we will probably be using Firebase Authentication to support our sign-up/log-in system, which is in the process of decision making as well.

Moje Recepty was the idea that sparked in the mind of my girlfriend when she realised she lacked space to store her fancy recipes.
